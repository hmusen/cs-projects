    # I learned something interesting here, python by itself adds a 0j to the end, incase the number that is square rooted is negative, thus resulting in a complex part to the number. I have gone out of my way to get rid of this by adding .real. alternatively, we can just do the solution below **0.5 which avoids this issue entirely, but thought this was cool to share. 
    
    # OR: ( ((self.width)**2) + ((self.height)**2) )**0.5
